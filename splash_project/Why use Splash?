Spalsh is used for JavaScript websites to render dyanamic content(content that renders when a user clicks on some icon/button in an app). 
Using scrapy would not help in fetching dynamic content from JavaScript websites.


Scrapy cons:
1. Doesn't support dynamic content rendering.
2. No browser interaction and automation.
3. Steep learning curve.
